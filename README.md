# OpenSolitaire
Solitaire Games for MonoGame and Unity

##Changelog

**5/2/2016 -** I finished the animation to get the cards rendering in the right places.  I also added code to move cards from the draw pile to discard pile.  Been stuck on the drag-and-drop code for a while, which is why there haven't been many updates.  Once I figure out how to get drag-and-drop working the way I want it to, I will start working on the actual game logic.

**4/1/2016 -** Microsoft Solitaire Collection decided to stop working for me in Win10 for some reason.  So I thought I'd craft my own Open Source version loosely modeled on the original Microsoft classic.  Nothing to see here yet, as I was just setting up the respository.
